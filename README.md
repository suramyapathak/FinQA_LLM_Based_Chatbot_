## Financial Quantitative Analysis with Generative Question Answering Chat Bot

This project is a generative question answering chat bot that leverages prompt engineering techniques to provide answers based on quantitative financial data. The chat bot is designed to answer questions related to financial data presented in both text and table formats. It aims to demonstrate the capabilities of generative models in providing informative responses to queries about financial data. The project is built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating web applications with simple and intuitive interfaces.
Overview

The project consists of a single paragraph of financial data that has been preprocessed for demonstration purposes. The data includes both textual descriptions and tabular information. The generative question answering chat bot uses this data to generate responses to user queries.
